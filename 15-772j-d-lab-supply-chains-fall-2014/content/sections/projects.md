For your term project, the intent is to study an existing or prospective supply chain for a D-Lab product or technology, or something comparable in intent and spirit. There is no single template for this project. But each project should think about the following questions:

*   What are the primary objectives and key performance measures for this supply chain?
*   What are the key challenges or issues in matching supply to demand for this supply chain? How would you characterize these as related to the material covered in the class?
*   How might these challenges be addressed, both in terms of the design of the supply chain, as well as supply chain planning and execution?
*   What are the implementation steps for either setting up or improving the supply chain?

We will try to initiate the projects in the first few weeks of the term, then have a mid-way check-in on your progress, and expect your **final presentation** and a **paper** in the last week.
